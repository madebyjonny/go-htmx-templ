# Go, Templ & HTMX

I created another project that does exactly the same thing with Bun, Hono & HTMX. The inspiration orignally was that it's typically difficult to create components with HTMX. 
As most languages outside of Javascript/Typescript don't support JSX or a templating langauge that is similar. I came across Templ, and that seemed to offer something very similar, and 
with it being outside of the JS world I wanted to give it ago. 

This is my first ever Go project so I imagine there is a few things I can clean up, but I'll get around to those as I learn more... 

## Running the app
- Ensure you have Go installed on your machine
- Pull down the repo 
- run `go run main.go`

## Creating new components
you will need to run `./cmd/templ generate` to create the corrosponding go files
